# peer-to-peer-learning
Decentralized school where peers learn from each other with certificate


# Abstract

A smart contract for an offline/online certified course

# How does this work?

Instructor will generate modules and labs for education. there is a shared data repository, for example github, where learners and instructors can look at their progress. Learners will work on the lab and submit their github repository link to Instructor. Instructor leaves comment on PR and gives certificate with ipfs hash or some hash that can be used as index to find the data in CDN. The reason why the hash is used is light client will eventually make statehash out of all the data stored as trie, and bunch of blobs will procrastinate the time significantly.
